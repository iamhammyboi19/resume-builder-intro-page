#### RESUME PROJECT

this is a project inspired by resume.io written in html css and javascript

###### About
-> I use to project for the intro/mainpage for my resume web application builder. I will keep updating it with css media queries and merge with the other page using node js. I will host the other page on netlify but as a desktop web application that is not yet responsive till I have time to finish the whole project with node js as I am currently busy with school work
